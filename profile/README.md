I'm impost0r, a, vulnerabilitiy researcher, exploit engineer and reverse engineer that currently specializes in Unixes and Unix likes!
What have I done? Good question.

üçé Rotten Apples v1 - macOS Big Sur code signing translocation exploit (writeup [here](https://www.osec.com/insights/rotten-apples-macos-codesigning-translocation-vulnerability) )
*  gzdoom stack-based buffer overflow - stack based buffer overflow in handling of WAD (Where's All the Data) files in gzDoom source port, leading to arbitrary register control/RCE via crafted WADfile
*  BFFx64 - CERT's "Basic File (format) Fuzzer", ported to 64 bit, allowing it to target more things.
*  [onionslice](https://github.com/impost0r/Misc-Tools/tree/master/onionslice) - Tor deanonymization via Shodan and misconfigured .onion
*  [Marathon](https://github.com/impost0r/Marathon) and [VTS Local Vulnerabilities](https://ret2p.lt/vts-local-vulnerabilities) -- responsible disclosure (ew) on VTube Studio local vulnerabilities and a patcher that fixes two of them.
*  And much more! Feel free to browse my repos! Some are simple tools, some are more complex tools to get the job done.

I also have a [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/serynyl) and [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@xpastor) where I ocassionally stream. Working on acquiring a capture card. Feel free to visit and say hi sometimes! You can find more about schedules and stuff on my Twitter (currently locked, just apply to follow!) here: [Twitter](https://x.com/impost0r_)

See ya around!
